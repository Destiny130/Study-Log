Want to do and done:
   1. Normal select with jQuery. Like $("#id") to find element with id.
   2. Change properties or values. Like $("#example").attr(...) or $("#example").text("...")
   3. Create a dynamic array in jQuery. 
          First create a string to collection array element split by ",", then use split method split them into a array.
   4. Use each function.
          $.each(todolist,function(i,item){...  //item is the element in the todolist})
        
Want to do but don't have enough capabilities:
   1. In jQuery, get List<string> from controller
          Try:       1. Try to use ViewBag, read it in jQuery, but can't convert it correct type.
          Solution:  1. Create a JSONResult in controller and get it in jQuery.
                     2. Use AJAX (no clue about it).
                     3. Others.
                     
Have an idea but haven't try it yet:
   1. Use Dictionary<string,List<string>> be a model to replace loop checkbox.
   2. Use checkboxlist helper method replace loop/dectionary method.
   3. Simplify checkbox loop block, then use parent/children method in jQuery.
