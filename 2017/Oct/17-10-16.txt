Today's studies:
   1. Using ajax in the program.
   2. To transform xml data as its originally, use 'HtmlEncode(xmldata)' in 'Controller', then transform it as a string.
   3. Used 'style="overflow:hidden;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap;width:200px"' to control a long string show in a single line,
      other part show as a '...'.
   4. 'position:absolute' is realated with its father container.
   5. 'word-break' has three mode:
          break-all: according to container's width to wrap, it can break a word to two parts.
          keep-all: keep word's completeness when line wrap.
          normal: default as browser settings.
   6. Add '<option disabled selected value></option>' as 'DropDownList's first element, when its page onload,
      its default selected element is none.


Today I use ajax complete one job in work program, but it can be done by simpler method.
So, first I will change it tomorrow. Second, I reminded myself, careful for the solidified thinking.
