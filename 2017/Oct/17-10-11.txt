Today's findings:
   1. When we use 'ViewBag' to transport a list to the view, we take it in 'script' which use  following sentence:
            var list = @Html.Raw(Json.Encode(@ViewBag.listname));
      Then the list we created that its' type just like an array created in the '<script>'.
      
   2. Fond an AutoComplete Widget which maybe have more function I don't find yet.
      I use it to achieve a function that the 'input' in the page will be real-time obtained, and will generate a 'DropDownList'    
   which contains all posibility result what you may want to type in.
      The widget's website in here:     http://api.jqueryui.com/autocomplete/
      The 'jquery-ui.css' and 'jquery-ui.js' are in the father folder.
      
            <input id="autocomplete">
            <script>
            var tags = [ "c++", "java", "php", "coldfusion", "javascript", "asp", "ruby" ];
            $( "#autocomplete" ).autocomplete({
              source: tags
            });
            </script>
