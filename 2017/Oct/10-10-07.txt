Learning some elementary course of JavaScript.
  1. JS only have number type.
  2. Bool can only have two value, can't be null.
  3. JS can create a dynamic array, I can use some function add new element to an array which already created.
  4. JS can create a anonymous type, and use it just like C#.
  5. Object created in JS is very flexible, we can add as much properties as we want.
  6. Assign a value to a variable which didn't declared in a function, JS will create it as a golbal variable.
     function aFunction()                                     function aFunction()
     { ...                                                    { ...
       var name = "Volvo";                                      var name = "Volvo";
       carname = name;     //Golbal variable                    var carname = name;  //Local variable
       ...                                                      ...
     }                                                        }

Will figure out it later:
  1. Can JS create a dynamic array?         CAN
     I want to use a function with click to add a element in array while button click, and count array length to check it.
