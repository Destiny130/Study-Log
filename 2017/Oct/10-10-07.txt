Learning some elementary course of JavaScript.
  1. JS only have number type.
  2. Bool can only have two value, can't be null.
  3. JS can create a dynamic array, I can use some function add new element to an array which already created.
  4. JS can create a anonymous type, and use it just like C#.
  
Will figure out it later:
  1. Can JS create a dynamic array?         CAN
     I want to use a function with click to add a element in array while button click, and count array length to check it.
