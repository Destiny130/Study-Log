   1. Add a number to a string, resule will be a string.
   2. For for loop, we can let the statement3 in  the block, then we can set some condiction to handle it, not blindly add/subtract.
   3. for/in in JS can generate a loop which can only get object's properties but elements in array.
   4. Use break and continue in for loop to control out result.
   5. continue with or without label cite can only use in the loop;
      break without label cite can only use in the loop, but with label cite can use in the block to interrupt block sentment.
