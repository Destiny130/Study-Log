Today's lesson:
   1. "position:absolute" is related with the nearest father node which has style "position:relative".
         <td style="height:100px;position:relative;">
            <div style="position:absolute;bottom:0px;">123</div>   
         </td>
         //Those sentences will set the div be the bottom in td.
