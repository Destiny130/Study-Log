Tech I done today:
   1. Get the data from the Model.
            @model Dictionary<string,List<SelectListItem>>
            var data = @Html.Raw(Json.Encode(Model.Keys));   //data is an array already.
            $("#testspan").text(data[2]);   //Just read it.
   
Want to but no ability yet:
   1. I know how to deliver a List<string> in jQuery where data come from the Controller.
            Controller: List<string> list = new List<string>{"s","d","f"};
                        ViewBag.list = list;
            jQuery:     var data = @Html.Raw(Json.Encode(@ViewBag.list));  //data is a string, should split it.
                        $("#testspan").text(data);
      But the page shows:   ["s","d","f"]
      I found when take a string list, it will add " automatic, maybe should write a method like trim to delete it.


Maybe carry out later:
