Tech I done today:
   1. Get the data from the Model.
            @model Dictionary<string,List<SelectListItem>>
            var data = @Html.Raw(Json.Encode(Model.Keys));   //data is an array already.
            $("#testspan").text(data[2]);   //Just read it.
   2. If use @Html.checkbox in the View, when we get the post data in the controller,
      we'll get one or two value which checkbox checked true will have true and false, uncheck will have false.
      For now, I use formcollection["name"].ToString().Contains("true") to check the checkbox checked or not.
   3. Each Html.Checkbox will creat two input element, we should halve it when we try to get the real count.
      This will happen when we count checked number to set the indeterminate property.
   4. Use the .siblings method in jQuery.
   
Want to but no ability yet:
   1. I know how to deliver a List<string> in jQuery where data come from the Controller.
            Controller: List<string> list = new List<string>{"s","d","f"};
                        ViewBag.list = list;
            jQuery:     var data = @Html.Raw(Json.Encode(@ViewBag.list));  //data is a string, should split it.
                        $("#testspan").text(data);
      But the page shows:   ["s","d","f"]
      I found when take a string list, it will add " automatic, maybe should write a method like trim to delete it.


Maybe carry out later:
   1. For now, I use Linq to inquiry data then write it in to DB.
      But I want to create a strong View by use DB model which be selected first.
      Now there be about three question:
         a. I create that model in the SetAuth Action by using Linq,
            when I write the post data to DB, is it use Linq again implicit.
         b. Does this method create a cleaner page?
         c. Could it use less loop?(This isn't I worried about, looping the db.sys doesn't expend much resources,
                                    it's a small DB, only have dozens items)
   2. Could I simplify jQuery code recently, I think it's too inefficient what I wrote those days.
      Every click will invoking some function, then ergodic many elements in the page
      which I just want ergodic siblings/parent/children.
   3. Learning some Ajax.
