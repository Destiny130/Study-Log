Tech I done today:
   1. I know how to convert a List<string> in jQuery where data come from the Controller.
            Controller: List<string> list = new List<string>{"s","d","f"};
                        ViewBag.list = list;
            jQuery:     var data = @Html.Raw(Json.Encode(ViewBag.list));
            Page:       ["s","d","f"]

Want to but no ability yet:

Maybe carry out later:
