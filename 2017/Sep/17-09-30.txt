Tech I done today:
   1. Get the data from the Model.
            @model Dictionary<string,List<SelectListItem>>
            var data = @Html.Raw(Json.Encode(Model.Keys));   //data is an array already.
            $("#testspan").text(data[2]);   //Just read it.
   2. If use @Html.checkbox in the View, when we get the post data in the controller,
      we'll get one or two value which checkbox checked true will have true and false, uncheck will have false.
      For now, I use formcollection["name"].ToString().Contains("true") to check the checkbox checked or not.
   3. Each Html.Checkbox will creat two input element, we should halve it when we try to get the real count.
      This will happen when we count checked number to set the indeterminate property.
   4. Use the .siblings method in jQuery.
   
Want to but no ability yet:
   1. I know how to deliver a List<string> in jQuery where data come from the Controller.
            Controller: List<string> list = new List<string>{"s","d","f"};
                        ViewBag.list = list;
            jQuery:     var data = @Html.Raw(Json.Encode(@ViewBag.list));  //data is a string, should split it.
                        $("#testspan").text(data);
      But the page shows:   ["s","d","f"]
      I found when take a string list, it will add " automatic, maybe should write a method like trim to delete it.


Maybe carry out later:
