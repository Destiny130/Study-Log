Want to do and done:
   1. Normal select with jQuery. Like $("#id") to find element with id.
   2. Change properties or values. Like $("#example").attr(...) or $("#example").text("...")
   3. Create a dynamic array in jQuery. !!17-10-16:For now, every array in js is dynamic, add element like 'arr[i+1]=99' or 'arr.push(99)'
          First create a string to collection array element split by ",", then use split method split them into a array.
   4. Use each function.
          $.each(todolist,function(i,item){...  //item is the element in the todolist})
   5. If I want to implement a select all function with checkbox, when I click it third time, it didn't word anymore.
      Solution is append .prop in click(funtion(){...})
             $("#selectAll").click(function () {
                 $("input[type=checkbox]").attr("checked", true);
             });
             $("#selectAll").click(function () {
                 $('input[type=checkbox]').prop("checked", this.checked);
             });
        
Want to do but don't have enough abilities:
   1. In jQuery, get List<string> from controller
          Try:       a. Try to use ViewBag, read it in jQuery, but can't convert it correct type.
          Solution:  b. Create a JSONResult in controller and get it in jQuery.
                     c. Use AJAX (no clue about it).
                     d. Others.
   2. Use for loop in jQuery.
                     
Have an idea but haven't try it yet:
   1. Simplify checkbox loop block, then use parent/children method in jQuery.
