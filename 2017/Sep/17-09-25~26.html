Want to do and done:
   1. Use FormCollection to collection element from View by <s>find id</s>.  !!10-10-12:BY NAME!!!
      For checkbox, if it's null, meaning View's checkbox not checked.
                    (But I feel it's not a safe method, maybe View have another element with the same id and has value)
   2. ViewBag can transport a anonymous type, but it can't accept it correctly in View.
      To fix it, use a Tuple method to send the anonymous type.
            Controller:   ViewBag.anony = db.ExampleDB.Select(a => Tuple.Create(a.ID, a.Name, a.Des));
            View:         @foreach(var ano in ViewBag.anoy)
                          {    @ano.Item1 //read the first element in anonymous type...   }
   3. Use foreach loop in View.
   4. Use BeginForm to post data to controller.
      
Want to do,tried but haven't much abilities yet: 
   
Have an idea:
   1. Use Dictionary<string,List<string>> be a model to replace loop checkbox.
   2. Use checkboxlist helper method replace loop/dectionary method.
